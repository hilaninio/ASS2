# Ass2 server-client 

## about this project
In this project we implement a server for the web-chat we created in assigment 1.<br>
Now all customer communication is done with the server and not with static lists.<br>
We have created an api server that accepts requests and responds in Json format to the customer.<br>
The requests are as required in the assigment, in addition we have added user's field as follows:

#### 'http://localhost:5281/api/ + user/+...'

## Rate page
We have created a page where you can rate the app.<br>
On this page you can add a new rating, edit an existing rating, delete a rating, search for a rating and view details of an existing rating.<br>
In addition this page has the average of the existing ratings.<br>
The rankings are stored in a database.<br>
